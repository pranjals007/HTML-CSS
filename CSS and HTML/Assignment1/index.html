        A film featuring the character was in development at Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox, and New Line Cinema at various times since 1990,
         before Marvel Studios reacquired the rights in 2005. Marvel put the project in production as its first self-financed film,
        with Paramount Pictures distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006, and faced opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey 
        in the title role; the actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007, primarily in California to
        differentiate the film from numerous other superhero stories that are set in New York City-esque environments. During filming, the actors were
        free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor,
         created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated imagery to create the title character.

        Iron Man premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the United States on May 2, as the first film i
